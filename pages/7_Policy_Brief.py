India's <b>Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)</b>, launched in August 2014, has achieved a remarkable milestone:
<b>45.8 crore bank accounts</b> opened for previously unbanked citizens, with <b>₹2.31 lakh crore</b> in deposits
as of 2024. This represents one of the world's most ambitious and successful financial inclusion drives,
lifting India's banked population from 53% to over 80% in a decade.

<p style='font-size:15px; line-height:1.8;'>
<b>However, this dashboard reveals a critical gap:</b> account opening has far outpaced account activation.
Analysis of real data across {len(df)} states and 104 districts shows that average balances remain thin
(national average: <b>₹{avg_balance:,.0f}</b> per account),
indicating that most PMJDY accounts function as <i>pass-through conduits</i> for wages and subsidies
rather than as genuine savings instruments.

    **Finding 1 — The Activation Gap**

    Having an account ≠ using an account.
    Karnataka district data shows 17–37% of
    accounts are **inactive** (no transaction
    in 90 days). Nationally, an estimated
    35–40% of PMJDY accounts are zero-balance.

    **Root cause:** Accounts were opened in
    government camps without building habits
    of saving. People lack trust, literacy, and
    nearby banking infrastructure to transact.

    **Finding 2 — The Cash Dependency Trap**

    Wage earners (MGNREGA, daily labour)
    receive payments via PMJDY but withdraw
    **immediately in cash**. The average
    balance of ₹3,703 nationally suggests
    money stays for days, not months.

    **Root cause:** No incentive to keep money
    in accounts. No interest on small balances.
    No easy digital payment options for
    rural purchases. Cash remains king.

    **Finding 3 — Geography Determines Fate**

    Avg balance ranges widely across states —
    a large gap between top and bottom states.

    outperform eastern and northeastern states.

    **Root cause:** Banking infrastructure,
    literacy, urbanisation and NREGA
    implementation vary wildly by state.

PMJDY FINANCIAL INCLUSION — POLICY BRIEF
Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%B %Y')}
Data: Ministry of Finance, GoI (Rajya Sabha Questions, 2022-2024)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
India's PMJDY has opened 45.8 crore accounts with ₹2.31 lakh crore in deposits (2024).
However, the national average balance is just ₹{avg_balance:,.0f} per account,
indicating most accounts are pass-through rather than genuine savings.

THREE CORE FINDINGS
===================
1. THE ACTIVATION GAP: ~35-40% of PMJDY accounts are inactive or zero-balance
2. CASH DEPENDENCY: 63% of all deposits come from accounts with < Rs.1,000 balance
3. GEOGRAPHIC INEQUALITY: Large gap in avg balance between best and worst performing states

SIX RECOMMENDATIONS
===================
1. Shift KPIs from accounts opened to accounts active
2. Mandate 7-day balance float on MGNREGA wages
3. Prioritize BC network in ML-identified high-priority districts
4. Women-specific financial literacy at MGNREGA worksites
5. Interoperable rural digital payment infrastructure
6. State-specific strategies — one policy cannot fit all
